Brainstorming what's important with TBA 2013

### Mobile
- Mobile growth up 130% y/y. Expect more growth.
- Mobile peaks during events
- How might we build amazing smartphone experiences at competitions?
    - My Team's dashboard
        - next match time, who's playing
        - results so far
        - hashtag search for #frc177
    - Peak in on other events, get a summary
    - Scouting at this competition, who's doing well, who do we pick?
    - Hashtag search - Instagram, Twitter, CD for events, encourage media posting -there_
- Rich bookmarks to home screens on Android, iOS

### Live Desktop
- Ustream links for every event
- Social media hashtag search for every event
- Chatrooms? Usually peak at like 100 people, not _huge_ opportunity

### Swag
- tshirts, stickers for laptops, stickers for robots
- how would we get swag in every FRC kit?
- swag store?

### Hashtags
- Why put "177" on bumper when could put "#frc177"?
- How do we make hashtags better?
- Can we work w FIRST marketing to get this announced @ kickoff?
- How can we get teams to put hashtags on their real shirts?
- Might we sell hashtag shirts just "#frc177"?

### YouTube
- On-site YT video submitter
- Can have add a video for this on Match pages w prepopulated search on YT
- Better YT admin tools, including building a reviewer type login thing
- Encourage YT vid upload on mobile web pages
- Hashtags compound here
- "These are the matches we most need YT vids for" based on PVs, solicit community
